# Containerization of Express App

## I followed my personal branching way

- `web-app` branch contains the source code of the app
- `Dockerization` branch contains the Dockerfile, .Dockerigore & VSCode configurations file
- Merged the `Dockerization` branch into `web-app` branch, then final step merged `web-app` branch into `main/master` branch

### These are tasks of the repository

* Creation of express app on host (require syntax) ✅
* Dockerization of express (Creating the image) `Dockerfile & .vscode config` ✅
* Building of the image `docker build ...` ✅
* Running of express-app-container and exposing the container's port on host ✅
* Using of docker-compose & volumes ❌
* Using of ENV and secrets ❌
